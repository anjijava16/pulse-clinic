*History:*

The very first version of this project was done by me in 2013 and within 2 weeks. Time past and I realized server side should be
changed from ServerSocket and private binary protocol solution to ReST API and application server what from my point of view is
simplier to understand and support. Many parts of base logic were changed and simplified within next 2 weeks, but there are 
still many things to do and many things have to be improved and optimized.

*TODO:*

* Add more security features (Like READ-ONLY analysis and form for example)
* Add multi-languages support
* Add unit tests
* Re factor maaaany parts, since they are really dirty ;)
* Put more comments
* Fix all warnings

*Requirements:*

* JDK 1.8
* Jetty/Tomcat/JBoss/GlassFish
